	 * Setting COM1A1 tells the microcontroller to set the 
	 * output of the OCR1A pin low when the timer's counter reaches
	 * a compare value (which will be explained below).  CS10 being

	 *  This loop is used to change the value in the OCR1A register.
	 *  What that means is we're telling the timer waveform generator
	 *  the point when it should change the state of the PWM pin.
	 *  The way we configured it (with _BV(COM1A1) above) tells the
	 *  generator to have the pin be on when the timer is at zero and then
	 *  to turn it off once it reaches the value in the OCR1A register.
	 *
	 *  Given that we are using an 8-bit mode the timer will reset to zero
	 *  after it reaches 0xff, so we have 255 ticks of the timer until it
	 *  resets.  The value stored in OCR1A is the point within those 255
	 *  ticks of the timer when the output pin should be turned off
	 *  (remember, it starts on).
	 *
	 *  Effectively this means that the ratio of pwm / 255 is the percentage
	 *  of time that the pin will be high.  Given this it isn't too hard
	 *  to see what when the pwm value is at 0x00 the LED will be off
	 *  and when it is 0xff the LED will be at its brightest.
